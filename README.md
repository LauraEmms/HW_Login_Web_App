# Task: to create a simple login-logout web app

---

## Login credentials to use:

Email: admin@user.com
<div> Password: admin123

### About: 

This projec uses 'useState' to add state management to the functional components with conditional rendering.

### Instructions for the simple web app:

When the user inputs the correct login details, they are redirected to a 'login successful page'. From here, they can click the 'logout' button to return to the homepage/login screen.

When the user inputs either an incorrect email, password, or both, they are redirected to a 'login unsuccessful' page. From here, they can click 'return to homepage' to revert back to the initial login/homepage screen.

If the user fails to input an email or password (the fields are empty), an alert pops up, prompting the user to input a valid email and password.
